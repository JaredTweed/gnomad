# DON'T REPORT THE VULNERABILITY HERE

This won't do any good! It will harm us and all other users!
Instead, please **report it privately** to `security@tblock.me` (PGP: `0x63180E50BC1EA89D`).
If you would like to submit a patch, please also send it privately to the same address (you will still be credited, don't worry).
Once we get your mail, we will:

- Write a patch (or review yours) and announce publicly a security release.
- Apply the patch and release a new version.
- Disclose the details of the vulnerability and who discovered it/wrote the patch once the new version is widely available.
